Repo for my client side scripting class

I did 7 labs in total (including a tutorial) for my client side scripting class. 
You should be able to run all the labs except for Lab 5 because it requires connection to Temple's database. 
Unfortunately, for security reasons, I can't upload my sql connection string to the database. And so for now,
you can only view the code itself. 

In total, my labs cover use of HTML and CSS with responsive design, JavaScript with dynamic data, Jquery with AJax, and Web APIs.
For my tutorial lab, I had to research a topic of my choice and write a tutorial on it. I did my tutorial on dynamics.js which is an open
source JavaScript library. 

All of my labs were posted on Temple's server and should be accessible via the link below.
