	<h2>Lab 1</h2>
	
	<p>Overall, my experience with front-end is very limited. I had previous experience in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when I took Server Side Scripting course. Although I did not use any advanced
	features because the pages I created were very simple. Going forward, the only framework I had exposure to was Bootsrap which I utilized in my Capstone 1 course. </p>
	<p>The advanced CSS techniques that I used for this lab were page layouts and box models. I heavily used floating techniques to make the content appear the way I want. I also used box model to get
	the right width of the element. Lastly, I incorporated responsive design to one the pags, where the content will display differently when screen is re-sized.</p>
	<p>I liked using page layout and box modeling techniques as they helped a lot with making the website look fluid and responsive. I also liked using navigation menus to navigate through different pages.
	With that being said, the only thing I disliked doing was finding the right width of elements, because it involves adding padding, border, margin and content size, which sometimes was confusing to get.</p>

	<h2>Lab 2</h2>
	
	<p>This lab was really long but doable. There were a lot of things to style but I managed to do it one by one. The hardest part of this lab
      was styling the Forms Page using table. It was hard to make the cells appear different when they are re-sized. Other than that, everything was fine.

          <h2>Lab 3</h2>

          <p>
              This lab was very interesting to do. I never had in-depth previous experience with JavaScript and this was very good learning experience.
              Because it is very similar to java in terms of oop, it was straightforward. I had problem with event listeners, they were some what hard to get
              used to. The only thing I disliked doing this lab was, finding celebrity pictures with almost the same size. But at the end, I really did learn a
              good deal.

          <h2>Lab 4</h2>

          <p>
              This lab took me very long to complete. It was not hard but it just took so much time to get it right. Thanks to this lab
              I learned how to work DOM and dynamically create and delete elements inside an HTML page. The only thing I disliked doing the labs was writing 20 questions
              and storing them as data. Other than that, I learned a great deal of JavaScript thanks to this lab. Link to my Lab 4.
